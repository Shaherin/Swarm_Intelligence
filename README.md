# Swarm_Intelligence

The aim of this project is to replicate and extend the work done by D.T. Pham et al. in their paper "Using the Bees Algorithm to schedule jobs for a machine". 

This is a comparative study of various heuristics and metaheuristics applied to the Single Machine Scheduling problem. Various optimization algorithms will be compared and hybridized in order to minimize the earliness and tardiness penalties of a set of processes.
The results will be compared to those in the original paper, as well as other solutions to the SMS problem.
