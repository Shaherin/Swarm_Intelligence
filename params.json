Pham et al. in their paper \"Using the Bees Algorithm to schedule jobs for a machine\". \r\n\r\nThis is a comparative study of various heuristics and metaheuristics applied to the Single Machine Scheduling problem. Various optimization algorithms will be compared and hybridized in order to minimize the earliness and tardiness penalties of a set of processes.\r\nThe results will be compared to those in the original paper, as well as other solutions to the SMS problem.<br />\r\nThis repository contains the Codeblocks Project(C++), and articles related to the work.\r\n\r\nCredit to M.E. O'Neill for providing an alternative to allow non-deterministic RNG for gcc on Windows, bypassing the random_device \"bug\". <br />\r\nhttp://www.pcg-random.org/blog/ <br />\r\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/34yqxa/announcing_randutils_a_single_portable/ <br />\r\n\r\nReleased under the GNU General Public License v3.0",
